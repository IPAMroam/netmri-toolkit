Example scripts for CCS and Perl, as well as Python access to the REST API.
Also includes example policies and policy rules.

Python Examples
---------------

The Python examples use https://github.com/infobloxopen/infoblox-netmri to
interact with the NetMRI.

The scripts will read the connection parameters from environment variables.
Change the netmri.env file to contain your connection details, then source it
before running the scripts.
